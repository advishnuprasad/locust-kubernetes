**Locust in Kubernetes for Performance Testing: A Powerful Combination**

Performance testing ensures your applications gracefully handle the anticipated—and even the unanticipated—demands of real-world use. Locust, an open-source load testing framework, and Kubernetes, a container orchestration system, offer a potent mix for streamlining and scaling your performance testing efforts.

**Why Locust?**

-   **Python Power:** Locust uses Python to define user behavior, making test creation intuitive and flexible. If you can code it, Locust can simulate it.
-   **Distributed Testing:** Effortlessly simulate massive numbers of concurrent users by running Locust in a distributed mode.
-   **Elegant Web UI:** Monitor your tests in real-time, gain deep insights into performance metrics, and identify bottlenecks thanks to Locust's user-friendly interface.

**Why Kubernetes?**

-   **Scalability:** Seamlessly provision and manage the resources your Locust deployment needs. Spin up workers as required and scale down when testing is complete.
-   **Resilience:** Kubernetes protects your test environment. If a worker node goes down, it automatically restarts pods, minimizing test disruption.
-   **Portability:** Replicate your Locust test infrastructure across different environments (testing, staging, production) with ease.

Create Locust Manifests
```
kubectl create ns locust
kubectl apply -f . -n locust
kubectl get svc -n locust (Copy the end point <endpoint>:8089)
```

Update configmap if code changed
```
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml -n locust && kubectl set env deploy/locust-master test=<random number> - locust && kubectl set env deploy/locust-worker test=<random number> -n locust
```
